Etzel is a Job Delegation & a queueing server.

We built etzel to solve the problem of existing queueing softwares which were bulky and slow.
we desired something fast & lightweight, which would be as reliable & robust as any enterprise software.

Another goal of Etzel is to keep things simple. Etzel uses a simple protocol based on websockets.
This makes Etzel as easy to connect as a HTTP service and yet have speeds similar to a raw TCP channel.

we would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone on the Erlang mailing list who helped us while designing the system architecture. 

Etzel uses a lot of libraries without which this project wouldn't be possible.
