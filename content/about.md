Etzel is a Job Delegation and queueing server.

We built etzel to solve the problem of existing queueing softwares which were either proprietary or bulky or slow.
we desired something fast, lightweight and well documented, which would be as reliable & robust as any enterprise software.

Another goal of Etzel is to keep things simple. Etzel uses a simple protocol based on websockets.
This makes Etzel as easy to connect as a HTTP service and yet have speeds similar to a raw TCP channel.

we would like to express our sincere gratitude to everyone on the Erlang mailing list who helped us while designing the system architecture. 

Etzel uses a lot of libraries without which this project wouldn't be possible.
